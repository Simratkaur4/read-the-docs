<li><h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>
The first step is to request for access to their testbed by filling out a simple form here: <a href="https://crnch.gatech.edu/request-rogues-access">https://crnch.gatech.edu/request-rogues-access</a></li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li><h3 id="access-to-georgia-tech">Access to Georgia Tech</h3>
<p>You will receive an email for your GA Guest account created and it will contain links and username and password access to the GA Tech &#39;passport&#39; login. </p>
<p><img src="gatech-passport.png" alt="passport"></p>
</li>
<li><h3 id="github-documentation">Github Documentation</h3>
<p>Once you login to the GA tech passport account, you can access their testbed documentation on Github at <a href="https://github.gatech.edu/crnch-rg">https://github.gatech.edu/crnch-rg</a></p>
</li>
<li><h3 id="fpga-documentation">FPGA Documentation</h3>
<p>Look for &#39;[Reconfig] Xilinx FPGAs Getting Started&#39; and follow the steps mentioned to log in to your VM. </p>
</li>
<li><p>You don&#39;t need to create extensive custom instantiations as for OCT. There are 3 different nodes for FPGAs depending upon your hardware usage. You have Pynq Z2 FPGAs, Ultrascale SoCs, and 3 Alveo 280 Datacenter cards. </p>
</li>
<li><p>rg-fpga-cubed.crnch.gatech.edu - The Pico Computing SC6 system contains HMC memory and Xilinx Ultrascale chips.</p>
</li>
<li>flubber1.crnch.gatech.edu - Hosts 3x Alveo U280 boards.</li>
<li>pynq-z2-<1-10>.cc.gatech.edu - Pynq Z2 FPGAs</li>
</ol>
<p>You can use these directly into your PuTTY terminal of your local system to access the board you require. </p>
<ul>
<li>Recurrent Error Message:  GAtech testbed responds very slow and can be highly unpredictable since it is still in its early stages and lacks documentation/Support. </li>
<li>The connection takes time and you can see time-out messages like this one frequently. </li>
<li><img src="gatech-error.png" alt="gatech-error"></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Another point to keep in mind is when you ssh into the VM (Let&#39;s say, you are using for Alveo card), access via flubber1.crnch.gatech.edu at port 22. Then once you get in, log in with your GA Tech passport username and password and you will get access. 
if you try - 
[username]@flubber1.crnch.gatech.edu directly on PuTTY (or any other ssh terminal) - it does not work. </li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>The VM already contains the Xilinx EDA tools like Vitis/ HLs on it. To start Vitis, check this :</li>

<ol>
<li><p>To access the GUI on CRNCH Rogues, you can use X2Go. 
check out their installation guide here: <a href="https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/doc:installation:start">https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/doc:installation:start</a></p>
<p>For Ubuntu : sudo apt-get install x2goserver x2goserver-xsession</p>
<p>Use your ssh host and GA Tech username and password to log in. 
<img src="gatech-x2go.png" alt="gatech-x2go"></p>
</li>
<li><p>Unless you are a GA Tech student/staff/faculty, you will have a guest account, and for that your need to add proxy settings. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>&#39;If you are not on campus VPN, you need to add the &quot;proxy setting&quot; for the X2go client to use rg-login.crnch.gatech.edu as your login or jump host proxy. Set the proxy to use the same login and password as the x2go server.&#39;</p>
<p><img src="gatech-proxy.png" alt="gatech-proxy"></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Once you are done, you can see the GUI access like this: </p>

<p>References: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Your main point of contact for CRNCH goes through GA Tech support portal or helpdesk@cc.gatech.edu or you can contact Dr. Jeffery Young at jyoung9@gatech.edu</p>
</li>
<li><p>Once you get access, you can use the documentation at Github linked above; like mentioned above, CRNCH is less supported and at times, unreliable. </p>
